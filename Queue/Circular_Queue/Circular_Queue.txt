// Queue Practical Implementation using arrays...
// Note: Same as queue but in circular motion...
//    # Future Self: Take note that as the rear is equal to the size of the array
//    # there is nothing you can do about it, in the run time. Its always full until
//    # you dequeue every element and you can't replace the dequeued elements.
//    # That's the problem with the simple queue itself.
//    # The Circular Queue fixed that problem by iterating to the entire queue itself...
//    # Both enqueue and dequeue work in the same manner to accomplish the task...
